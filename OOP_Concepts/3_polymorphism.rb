# Polymorphism using Inheritance
# Inheritance is a property where a child class inherits the properties and methods of a parent class. One can easily implement polymorphism using inheritance.




# Polymorphism using Duck-Typing
# we focus on the objectâ€™s capabilities and features rather than its class. So, Duck Typing is nothing but working on the idea of what an object can do rather than what it actually is.
